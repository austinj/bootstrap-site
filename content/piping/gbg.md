basic_name: "Good Behavior Game"
basic_why: "Because you like the idea of students working together in teams to support one another towards being successful. You have specific time periods during the day when you'd really like to focus in on supporting positive behavior. TEST"
basic_pros: "It can be done without any materials besides a white-board, it's flexible towards the behaviors you want to encourage among your students, and it's got a long history of success. TEST"
basic_cons: "There is a level of competition built into the Game which you might be uncomfortable with. However, as long as both teams can win (which we think is a smart way to run this intervention), it should be a supportive (rather than competitive) experience for kids. TEST"
