# Our three core principles

## 1. Teacher-centered

### You know your kids. We know the literature.

We started the IBL in order to provide tools that respond to *actual teacher needs*, not anybody else's. That's why we give you reproducibles you're proud to share with your class, editable files for you to customize, data sheets that don't make you want to cry, and instructions that actual teachers have proofread for clarity. More than anything, *we want to give teachers tools that they want to use*. We call them Recipes, but you can call them Planning Period Reclaimers.

# 2. Evidence-based

## Written like we want

You're teaching for eight hours a day. We're writing journal articles that, let's face it, no one is reading but us. If we want science to be usable by folks in schools, we need to *write it like we want people to read it*. So, we

# 3. Community-driven

## We can't do this alone, and we don't want to.

The literature on strategies to support student behavior is huge. We can't do this alone, and we don't want to. We've developed a bunch of Recipes to get us started, but we're nowhere near finished. Head over to the [Contribute](contribute.html) page to learn to add to this free and open resource.

# 4. Open-source

## We show our work.

We believe in open science. Research belongs to everyone, and for that reason, all of our materials use a Creative Commons license that specifies that you are free to use, edit, and redistribute all of these materials as long as you (a) allow your work to be shared too, (b) do not engage in commercial use of these materials, and (c) attribute the materials to IBL. We also show our work by providing in-line citations for the information we provide, like this one. We use open-source tools like Bootstrap and Jekyll to power this website, and our code is freely available on Github for you to fork to your heart's content.
